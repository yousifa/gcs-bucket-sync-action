# GCS Bucket Sync Action
This action helps by easily syncing a Github repository with a Google Cloud Storage bucket. It is very generic and can be used for different purposes. I used it for uploading my static website.

## Features
- [X] Sync files/directories from your repository to your bucket
- [X] Delete files/directories from your bucket which where removed in your repository
- [X] Exclude certain files from being synced with the bucket

## Requirements
- An existing empty* bucket
- A service account with access to the bucket
- The service account key _(json format)_

_\*If you want to sync to an exiting bucket, make sure that your repository includes the whole content of it, otherwise you could lose data!_

## Inputs
- `secrets` Your Google service account credentials as json. _**(Required)**_
- `bucket` Name of the target bucket. _**(Required)**_
- `subdirectory` Name of the subdirectory to deploy.
- `exclude` Regex for excluding files/dirs. ([gsutil rsync doc](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/rsync))

## Example

```
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Sync
        uses: patrickwyler/gcs-bucket-sync-action@1.0
        with:
          secrets: ${{ secrets.google_service_account_credentials }}
          bucket: 'patrickwyler.com'
          subdirectory: 'build'
          exclude: '.*\.md$|.gitignore$|.git\/.*$|.github\/.*$'
```
